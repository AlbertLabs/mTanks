#Ruby on Rails (4.2.0)

##Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **Start Rails Server** : When you come into your Project, you should start the Rails server. If you like, you can create a [startup.sh](/docs/boxes/startup/) file to start whenever your project loads.
1. **Preview** : This previews your app in a new browser window.

##Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your Rails project can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
https://vital-ego.box.codio.io:3000/
```


##How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `Rails` Codio Certified Stack (Node, Grunt, MongoDB, Rails). The following commands were used to create the code workspace

```bash
gem install rails
rails new .
```
